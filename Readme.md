# Mac Installation Script

This repository contains an Ansible playbook to automate the installation of essential software on macOS using Homebrew.

## Prerequisites

- **macOS**: Ensure you are using macOS (Darwin).
- **Ansible**: Make sure Ansible is installed. You can install it using pip or Homebrew.
- **Homebrew**: This playbook will install Homebrew if it is not already installed.

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install Homebrew

Run the following command in your terminal to install Homebrew:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### 2. Set Up Your PATH

Add Homebrew to your PATH by running these commands:

```bash
echo >> ~/.zprofile
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile 
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

### 3. Install Python

You can install Python using Homebrew with:

```bash
brew install python
```

Add Python to your PATH if needed:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin:$PATH"
```

### 4. Install Ansible

If Ansible is not installed, you can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install ansible
```

### 5. Modify Your .zprofile

Edit your `~/.zprofile` to include the following lines:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/Users/{user}/Library/Python/3.9/bin"
export PATH="$PATH:/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin"

```

Then, source your `.zprofile`:
